This program is a simple simon game.

Hardware:

    You need to make the same circuit than the fritzing schema. The red led must be plugged on the pin 2, the yellow led on the pin 16, the blue led on the pin 0 and the green led on the pin 15. If you want to add a piezo, you can add it on the pin 12.


Software:

    To make it work, you first need to replace ssid on line 3 with your wifi ID and password on line 4 with your wifi password.


Then start the program and, on your phone browser, go to the IP address written in the serial monitor.

You can now play the game.
